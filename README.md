# Overview

* Whitening: Using average PSD. Averaging over all noise samples for each site.
* CQT Scaling with `filter_scale = 8/bins_per_octave` and (fmin, fmax)=(20, 1024).  Both abs and angle part were used.
* Augmentation
    * Horizontal/time shift
        * Pad both side and then horizontal random crop to get time shift image. -> ROC +0.002.
    * Mixup, prevent from overfitting
* GeM Fixed power 3 was better than the trainable case. -> ROC +0.001

* Scores

| net       | spec     | height | width | PB score |
| ---       | ---      | ---    | ---   | ---      |
| effnet b0 | Log STFT | 256    | 513   | 0.8760   |
| effnet b0 | CQT      | 181    | 513   | 0.8768   |
| effnet b3 | CQT      | 181    | 1024  | 0.8797   |
| effnet b3 | CQT      | 273    | 1024  | 0.8802  |

My final score is ensemble of Log STFT/CQT models.

# How to run
## environment
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Python with Anaconda/Mamba

## Data Preparation
First, download the data, [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/data),
and then place it like below.
```bash
../input/
    â”” g2net-gravitational-wave-detection/
```
Outputs will be stored under `../working/` through [hydra](https://hydra.cc/).

## Code&Package Installation
```bash
# clone project
$PROJECT=kaggle_g2net_gravitational_wave_detection
git clone https://github.com/Fkaneko/$PROJECT

# install project
cd $PROJECT
conda create -n g2_net python==3.8.10
bash install.sh
 ```
* This code was for the competition, so some parts of code are not so clean or clear. Please be careful.

## Training & Testing
Simply run followings
```python
